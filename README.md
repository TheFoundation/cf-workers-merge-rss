# Worker-planet

This project is meant to be an easy way to aggregate in a single page content from multiple sources.
It takes a list of existing RSS feeds, aggregates their contents and displays them in chronological order.

It was inspired by other software packages such as [Planet](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)>) and [MoonMoon](https://moonmoon.org/) but runs on top of Cloudflare Workers instead of being deployed on your own server.

This ends up being specially useful for communities, in order to follow the work being done and published by its members. Some examples of existing "planets" (using different software):

- https://planet.debian.org/
- https://planet.kde.org/
- https://planet.gnome.org/
